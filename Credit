Participant A
Aniket, art teacher, 30 years old based out of West bengal. Stays with family - parents and brother. Father is also an earning member of the family. Family is well to do, but wants to be independent and save up for his future.
Unmarried currently. Very focussed on saving money and planning for the future/retirement. Lives frugally in the present to reap the benefits in the long run.
Current expenses:
Invests 50% of his salary monthly, and 20% is for reserved savings, makes do for his expenses with the remaining 30%
Investment journey. Shifted to Groww from Angel in 2019-2020. Groww is much different than other stocks broker. Simplified interface.
Has a home loan running at present
Groww loans:
Has taken loans form Groww 6 times - 4 have been paid fully
5 times was for him for trading as additional funds - max amount is 20K at a time
“Aaj to jee lete hai but I would better prefer- - unmarried person, then lead life with good financial freedom. This is not nasha to me but a passion/dedication. Being experience investor, mera pura list rehta hai ki har mahine SIP se konsa stock kharidna hai, multiple instances- haven’t taken loan of big amount. I wanted to buy L&T infotech, I didn’t use my reserve for this. 5k k saath me 89 rs fees. Not too much. Stocks lene se satisfaction milega.”
1 time 50K for his uncle who did not have access to Groww credit - pays the EMIs using his funds, uncle pays him 25th of every month
Finds his credit limit on Groww to be very low - 75K, has compared with offers for his friends who have lower credit scores, but offers of 125L, expects at least 1.5L - 2L limit for his credit score, past record adn payment capability
Prefers unsecured loans - does not want to provide collateral for higher amounts - would not provide his holdings /securities as collateral
Did not consider any other platform when taking these loans, even though he has offers from multiple banks and NBFCs because has his portfolio on Groww and trust Groww
Feels other places charge high ROI and PF which is not justified
does not want to share his PAN and Aadhar details with a lot of institutions
Would be ok to share SMS/Email/banking details for better offers since he completely trusts Groww
If Groww stops credit: Would just save up and wait to invest instead of taking loans from elsewhere > Had 2lac offer from Bajaj but did not consider it, does not want to share details with everyone
Likes: Groww is trustworthy, seamless, quick, unsecured loan, low PF, good ROI
Improvements: Higher credit limit and wants the available credit limit to be autoupdated after each repayment - has had to call CS multiple times because the amount does not auto update to reflect latest credit limit
75k limit is very low for me. Mera 1-2 friend ka same income and credit score is worse but offered 1.5L-2L. He felt bad as he is old and loyal user to Groww. 1.5-2 lac is expected.
Credit card:
CC- uses credit cards, all bills cleared on time. 2 cc- indusand, kotak bank
I use it wisely, last 2 month me credit card down tha.A
AC lena tha. Speaker, mobile kharidna hai etc.
Regular expense me- EMI,
Reasons for loans:
Loan requirement: loan lene se pehle evaluate karta hu- wild thing in falling wild trap.
House loan was was necessary.
Other players:
Offers on other? IDFC, other NBFC, IIFL, bajaj finance, rofelo, kredit bee, kotak bank, HDFC bank etc.  But I did not consider, Trust on Groww
My family economic condition is strong. I can ask my father but I won’t do that. Groww is there. I don’t consider anything else.
Dusra koi platform dekhta bhi nahi. Micro-loans 5k pe 500-600 ka convenience katenge, unfair. On groww is it too less 89 rs. I don’t think of anything else but Groww
Experience before Groww:
I checked with others- before groww, that time I didn’t have proper job, I was in desperate need - rofelo, nightmare. Terms were not said clearly. Threatened me literally. If I took 5k in 7 days then why 500 charges?
I am not going to take any sort of loan in future. Groww ka anokha laga. - Bahot fayemand feature hai. Killer product.
Given proper info on payment structure. 5k and distribute then 9-12 month. Telling in detail. Groww is 3rd largest to kuch to bharosa banta hai, not any random platform.
12.5% -ROI- excellent. Global bank interest are increasing. Will not compare NBFC with bank. Minimum 14% se upar rehta hai.
Discontinued: Investment, PAN k ek jagah pe include kiya.
Chahiye kitna? Is groww able to provide money? Bank se uthaoge to bank ka process- convenience of process.
Collateral: If you had option: 75k, what basis of credit score at the time. Uss time pe homeloan shuru hua tha. Abhi repayment badhiya hai. Don’t provide collateral, I prefer an unsecured loan.
