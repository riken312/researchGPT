Kumar Nil Dutta. Transcipt of the research interview

00.01
M: OK tell me something about yourself and I am from Gujarat but I work in Bangalore and I have come here for Diwali celebration and I have been in Bangalore for 6 years and I am a researcher  ?
R: My name is Kumar Nil Dutta and I have done my B.Tech in civil engineering and right now I am working in a college as lecturer in an engineering college and before this job I have worked with L & T, Simplex, Upcom and Tata and everything 

01.16
M:Ok where are you working and who else in your family?
R: yeah my home town is Kolkata otherwise I have worked everywhere and my family members are old persons my mom and dad and there is no one to take care of them so I have changed my profession and now I have become a teacher or lecturer and since 2019 I have been working as lectrurer 

01.59
M:OK now I would like to discuss your investment goals how did you start and how did you discovered Groww and all that since when you have been investing?
R: yeah initially I have opened an account with Axis bank and it was 2015 and they asked me to open a demat account and that time I did not have the knowledge of demat account and brokerage 
And since then I have invested in so many stocks and earned profit and I have purchased the shares of REC in 2016 and it was rural electrical corporations and it was on the recommendation of the banks and I purchased it at 79 and its price has not gone up in 2021 and after huge loss I have stopped investment 
But my friend told me about this app Groww and you can invest easily and brokerage is very less 0.05 percent per order and it was only 20 rupees and there is no account maintenance charges and you can raise your questions from the customer care and its interface is very user friendly and it is very good and I have accounts with uptocks and angel broking but I don’t feel they are user friendly and from last month I have started investing in Groww and I have invested 30000/

04.29
M:OK when you came to know about Groww last month?
R: yeah before that I have seen its app in google play store but I was not aware what groww is doing and I saw its ad in the cricket match it is fine app

05.04
M:OK we wanted to discuss charges and etc first of all you told me charges are 0.05 and it is very lower and you have accounts with other apps like Upstocks and angel broking so what do you think about the Groww?
R: yeah it is very good for me not every one is regular investor and we are small investor if there is saving we invest it
It is not possible to save too much money and if I invest small amount and for that I give annual maintenance charges that it too much and upstocks does not have annual maintenance charges it is very good for middle class people and for high class people 
And it is very good platform so I would say Groww is thinking for every one

06.33
M:OK and I want to go little bit in detail and tell me what kind of investment you do on stocks and do you do intra day ?
R: yeah from last month I have started learning from a friend and I am learning from you tube videos and there is so much content on you tube there and they tell us what is IPO and N&O and there is stock SIP is there and I asked groww customer care executive and SIP is not available there and there are so many stocks like Bajaj finserve IRCTC and there are so many stocks and we want to invest and their stock price is high and if I have 500 rupees I can purchase little bit units and that should be included in Groww

07.59
M:OK we have noted your feed back and I want to understand how you have bought and sold stocks in last one month and what was the deductions from groww?
R: yeah I have invested in Nify and its charges are very less and its charges are 5 to 6 rupees

08.35
M:Ok and how do you realise what are the charges and how you get to see it?
R: yeah initially I was not able to understand the charges but they have sent me the statement and it  has everything and there is brokerage calculator in it and I can calculate and how much money I have to pay and there are government charges and it is reasonable 
And they sent me mails and I like it

09.35
M:OK and I want to know when do you see the calculator do you see it during the buying and selling or afterwards?
R: yeah before sell I have seen it and after buying I got exact figure what they are charging and it is transparent 

10.10
M:Ok and where do you see these charges on the phone or laptop or something?
R: yeah I do it with my smart phone 

10.21
M:OK can you share the screen and show me how you do that and are you planning to buy and sell something ?
R: No before buying and selling I have to do some research and I have not researched anything 
And prices are shown here and here is the brokerage calculator 
Equity delivery is there and intraday is there

11.30
M:OK and you are doing intra day or delivery?
R: yeah I have not done intra day and I have not that much experience 

11.43
M:OK can you open it again and I want to ask something did you know different aspects of charges?
R: yeah I don’t know about the STP charges and taxes and I know about GST but I don’t know about the stamp duty 
And I think 20 rupees are taken by  Groww and I don’t know the other charges

12.36
M:Ok and in this I want to know what do you understand and you said brokerage is what groww is charging, and you don’t have any idea about the STP?
R: yeah STP charges are confusing for me exchange charges are confusing and stamp duty is confusing 
Sebi charges I  can understand and it is 0.05 and rest of the three is not clear to me 

13.45
M:OK do you think any of the charges are hidden based on your experience till now?
R:No it is not hidden but total order value is 50000/ and it is showing total charges are 83/ and 20 rupees is charged by groww and they have mentioned it and rest of things are clear and no hidden charges

14.30
M:OK let  us assume you are ordering 50000/ and 83 will be charged or some additional will be charged ?
R: I think 83 is fine and they are charging STP from government and it is higher and it is regulatory charges and groww cannot do anything 

15.02
M:OK and have you tried out these charges in any other platforms like Angel broking and upstocks?
R: No I have not seen the brokerage calculator there easily and I am not able to get the comparison 
And groww is fine and they make everything clear

15.37
M:OK and have you heard about the DP charges?
R: it is demat something I have heard but don’t know about it

15.55
M:OK can you go back and show me some transactions have you ever sold any stocks?
R: No I have only purchased and I am showing you my investment 
I have not sold anything and I have started in just one month and there will be no huge profit and I will have to wait for one year and my investment is in SIP 
And I have bought some nifty stocks and it is showing 22 rupees return currently 
And I want to wait for one year and I have not started intraday and it needs experience and research and I don’t have that much experience of chart

17.12
M:OK what are the things the groww can do to improve and you said whatever the government is charging should be reduced any other point you want to make?
R: yeah I think Groww is charging very less they are charging 20 rupees and they are doing business and we are the source of income for them and they are charging less

17.58
M:OK and one last exercise from me and I want you to show me the stocks ?
R: yeah I have purchased last month nifty 

18.33
M:Ok and let us say one of the stocks is 3000/ and you want to sell and I want to see what are the charges will be deducted from groww side end of the day and if you had to do that how would you go about it?
R: yeah again I will go to brokerage calculator and from there I will get it and it is for sales
Sale charges are at the time of sale 75 rupees and there is no duty charges and regulatory charges are 4 and at that time it is 5 and it has reduced little bit

19.35
M:Ok and let us assume the 3000/ rupees is  the amount and tell me what will be different charges ?
R: yeah I have my investment here and your amount is 3000/ and it is showing 4.89 and groww is charging 1.50 as they have told me it is lower 

20.47
M:Ok and I want you to stay here and you come next day and in your groww balance how much would it reflect what will be the groww balance after selling the stocks?
R: net value 2995.11 in my groww account 

21.16
M:OK and now you want to buy again some new stocks and you have amount 2500/ what would be your thoughts ?
R: yeah initially I would wait and groww is sending me the mails and statement and if they don’t send I would go to helpline and kindly tell me I  am supposed to get 2995 and I am getting 2500/ and how they have deducted the money 

22.12
M:OK and can you scroll down a little and there is small disclaimer can you read this?
R: Yeah dp charges are excluded please check the price pages for details
I have not seen it

22.35
M:OK and you have missed it earlier?
R: yeah I have missed it

22.39
M:OK if we are doing peak margin do you know anything about peak margin?
R: NO

22.57
M:Ok and those were the details I wanted to check with you do you have any feed back you can share with me and tell me how we can make groww better for you?
R: No it is fine
This should be improved the watch list and I have to click here and then I get and they should have another page of the watch list
It is not easier and I am opening the app and watch list be there 
Stocks and SIP should be included

24.14
M:OK we have seen the example of 3000/ and you get 2500/ would you reach out to your friend or customer care for clarity ?
R: yeah I would reach out to customer care definitely and they would explain me properly and if I go to my friend they would direct me to customer care

24.54
M:OK it is all from my side and I will send you gift tomorrow ?
R: yeah 

M:Ok thank you very  much
